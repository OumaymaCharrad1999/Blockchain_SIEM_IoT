Requirements 
    1) Install Docker 
    2) Install GO language
    3) Make sure that the rsyslog daemon is running 
    4) And most importantly grap with you a cup of hot coffee <3 




Steps 
1) First configure the rsyslog daemon as the following. 
    -------------------------------------------------

# We will create a template in rsyslog configuration. The template allows us to control witch data would be printed in the log files
    $template class, "%syslogseverity%,  %syslogfacility%, %timegenerated%,  %HOSTNAME%,  %syslogtag%,  %msg%\n"
# The destination log file us the following. 
# All the logs with all facilities and severities levels would be logged on this destination. 
# Make sure to add the syslog file context on the directory in order to allow rsyslogs to log on the directory (SElinux <3).
    *.* {{your project path}}/test-network/filename.txt;class

    --------------------------------------------------

2) Make sure to reload the rsyslog daemon.

3) Run the ./test-network/mine.py python3 script.
The previous script test each period of time if any new line is appended on the my log file. 
If this is the case, a new block would be added on the ledger.
